                <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art Website</a>
            </h3>

            <p>
                Yale School of Art's webite is used to give out information to those 
                looking to attend Yale's School of Art graduate school course. It contains 
                the work of some of the previous students who went to Yale School of Art. 
                There are many visuals and bright vibrant colors.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>C- Contrast</li>
                <p>
                    It is very hard to read the content of the pages because of there is not 
                    enough contrast witht he baackground and the text. It is hard to focus on 
                    ehat you are trying to read because some words blend in witht the surroundings.
                </p>

                <li>R- Repition</li>
                <p>
                    There is no real repition except for the style of the boxes. While that is 
                    a repeating factor, it is not a good one as it messes with the visuals of 
                    the website.
                </p>

                <li>A- Alignment</li>
                <p>
                    The alignment is not good on this website. Everything is set on the 
                    left side of the screen on every page, where you can scroll to the next 
                    bit of random information they have.
                </p>

                <li>P- Proximity</li>
                <p>
                    While everything is grouped together in text boxes, there is no real 
                    order to what the inforamtion is set in. Then, when you click on the 
                    pages in the navigation, everything is sort of forced together.

            <h3>
                <a href="https://www.soccer.com/">Soccer.com</a>
            </h3>
                
            <p>
                Soccer.com is a website where soccer players can go and buy gear to help 
                improve training, improve performance, or even support their team. There 
                is a possible membership that you can sign up for that can set you up to
                get discounts on future purposes. This site has many different pages, and 
                is locatd at the top of the page.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>C- Contrast</li>
                <p>
                    The contrast on Soccer.com is strong, making every word vissible. The 
                    readability is easy on the eye, as the size of the words is good with
                    contrasting dark and light colors for the background and words.
                </p>

                <li>R- Repition</li>
                <p>
                    The repition on this website is consistent and appealing. The combination 
                    of black, white, and red is easy and iconic for the brand.
                </p>

                <li>A- Alignment</li>
                <p>
                    The alignment is even and efficient to include the maximum amount of information 
                    in one section to where it is not overwhelming. The categories are organized 
                    and lined up perfectly.
                </p>

                <li>P- Proximity</li>
                <p>
                    The proximity on Soccer.com is as good as it gets. There are multiple categories 
                    that have sub categories that can help you get to what you need as quick as 
                    possible.
