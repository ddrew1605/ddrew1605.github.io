        <h3> Personal Background </h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> I was born in Fort Riley, Kansas. Growing up I was a military brat, 
                so the first few years of my life, I jumped from state to state. After 
                my dad got medically discharged, my family settled in North Carolina,
                where I'd eventually be raised. </li>
                <li> I love soccer, Chelsea FC being my favorite club. I love to be active
                and play sports, as well as watch them. This shows as I am in five different
                fantasy leagues. </li>
                <li> I decided to enter the computer science field because I was always fascinated
                by computers and technology. Eventually, I found out how easy it can be for
                people to have access to others' information, and now, I'd like to help
                stop the problem. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
        <h3> Professional </h3>
        <p> My professional career has yet to start, but I am currently looking 
        for internships that I can work for in the upcoming summer, or possibly in 
        school. </p>
    
        <h3> Academic Background </h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> I attended high school at a small private school in Goldsboro, North
                Carolina called Wayne Country Day School. </li>
                <li> I am in my Junior year at Charlotte, and I plan on graduating in
                Computer Science with a concentration in cybersecurity in 2023. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
    
        <h3> Why Am I Taking This Course? </h3>
        <p> I am taking this course because in order to help others as a cybersecuirty
        specialist, I need to know the how things on the internet are created, including
        websites. It is for thi reason it is a required class for my major to graduate. </p>
    
        <h3> My Other Courses </h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> FREN 1201-003 </li>
                <li> ITSC 3688-005 </li>
                <li> FILM 2201-003 </li>
                <li> ITSC 3155-001 </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
        <h3> Background In Course </h3>
        <p> I have no real background in making a website through html. I had to make a
        website for a class my freshman year, but that was more or using tools on another
        website, where I drag the item then do what I need with it. </p>
    
        <h3> Primary Computer Platform </h3>
        <p> My primary computer platform is Windows 10, but I intent on buying a Mac product
        to join my windows laptop. </p>
    
        <h3> Funny Story About Me </h3>
        <p> One time, when I was a kid, my parents took me and my older sister (I also 
        have a little brother but he wasn't born yet) to Six Flags. WHile we were there,
        I saw a bumper car ride that I thought was really cool. So, I ran full speed over
        to it. When I turned around, no one was there. I started to pannic and frantically
        spun in circles. The whole time, my family was at a bench watching me, knowing I 
        was okay, but showing me I cannot run off like that. </p>
    
        <h3> Something Else </h3>
        <p> I did not start in depth coding until I started college. My only experience
        before hand was an AP Computer Science Principles class that was not too challenging
        and only showed you a glimpse into the world of coding. As a Junior, I can say coding
        can be possible for anyone as long as you put in the time, effort, and practice. </p>
